## Project Overview

This backend project replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb’s rental marketplace platform. It provides the server-side logic, database management, and API endpoints needed to power a secure, scalable, and efficient rental booking system.

Users can register as guests or hosts, manage property listings, search and book rentals, process payments, leave reviews, and receive notifications. Admins have dashboards for monitoring and managing platform activities.
